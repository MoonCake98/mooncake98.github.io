                       There are fewer functional T-cells and

                        <h2>Deficiency in T Cells (1)</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the case of Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) deficiency, ADA is an enzyme that plays an important role in purine metabolism by breaking down adenosine and deoxyadenosine. In individuals with ADA deficiency, these metabolites accumulate because they cannot be properly degraded. This accumulation leads to several toxic effects on lymphocytes, particularly T cells. 

                            The buildup of adenosine and deoxyadenosine results in the formation of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), which is toxic to developing lymphocytes. dATP interferes with ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis, and inhibiting cell proliferation and differentiation. This disruption is mostly bad for T cells, as they require fast proliferation and differentiation for immune function. 
                            <br>
                            The toxicity of these metabolites affects both the thymus, where T cells mature, and the bone marrow, where hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into various immune cells. The damage to developing T cells in the thymus leads to a severe reduction or absence of functional T cells in the peripheral blood. This deficiency impairs cellular immunity, making individuals with ADA-SCID highly vulnerable for infections. 
                            
                            Also, the accumulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine can also affect other cell types, including B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, although the impact is generally worse on T cells. The overall effect is a immunodeficiency that requires early intervention, typically through hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or gene therapy, to restore immune function. (See the page about treatment options)
                            <br>
                            Early diagnosis of ADA deficiency is important to improve the outcome. Newborn screening programs and genetic testing can identify affected infants before they develop severe infections. Enzyme replacement therapy with polyethylene glycol-modified ADA (PEG-ADA) can be used as a temporary measure to reduce the accumulation of toxic metabolites until definitive treatment, such as HSCT or gene therapy, can be implemented.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                X-linked SCID (SCID-X1) accounts for 50â€“60% of cases of SCID. It is characterized by an absence of mature T and NK lymphocytes, whereas B cells have a normal phenotype and are present in increased numbers.  
                                But there are other factors that can change the count of B-cells like IL-21 signaling. 
                            Impaired IL-21 signaling can have significant effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses.
                            IL-21 promotes the activation and proliferation of B cells. In the absence of functional IL-21 signaling, B cells can exhibit reduced responsiveness to antigenic stimuli, leading to decreased proliferation and activation.

                            <p>
                             Although not all patients lack natural killer cell activity, it is the case in the majority of the patients.
                             There are different types of SCID like "T-B-NK+ SCID" and "T-B-NK- SCID". 
                             T-B-NK+ SCID: In this form, T and B cells are absent or non-functional, but NK cells are present and functional.
                             T-B-NK- SCID: In this form, all three types of lymphocytes (T, B, and NK cells) are affected.
                             <br>
                             The presence or absence of functional NK cells can influence the clinical course and treatment options for SCID patients. For example, patients with functional NK cells may have a better prognosis in terms of infections.
                             NK cell function is important for controlling viral infections and certain types of cancer, so its presence can provide some level of immune protection.
                             Flow cytometry can be used to assess the number and function of NK cells in peripheral blood samples.
