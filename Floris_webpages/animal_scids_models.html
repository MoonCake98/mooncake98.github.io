                            An animal model in the context of biomedical research is a non-human species used in research that has properties that are similar enough to that of a human's to serve as a comparable stand-in. In the context of SCIDS specifically this refers to the workings of the immune system, for the case of SCIDS the immune system of a mouse suffering from SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) was deemed similar enough that in combination with human cells and tissues it was adequate in similarity to be seen as a viable model for the human immune system. 
                            
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reason for this is essentially that due to the practical lack of an immune system from the SCID mice, it's possible to replicate some base parts of the human immune system within these mice. This is done by introducing human HSCs (hemiopoeitic stem cells) into the mice.  These HSCs produce functional key types of white blood cells thus effectively mimicking a human immune system within a living subject.

                            This model was initially developed in the 1990s and today there is a standardised protocol for engineering such mouse models. The most commonly used mouse model is called the humanised SRC-SCID model, with the three parts of this model's naming convention standing for the following main traits of the model:
                            <ul>
                                <li>humanised: introduced a human element within the mice</li>
                                <li>SRC: SCIDS-Repopulating Cells, aka the human HSCs referred to above that can proliferate and en graft themselves within the mice</li>
                                <li>SCID: mice that initially suffer from Severe Combined Immunodeficiency</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                            This model has proven it's value especially due to the practical simulations that were able to be performed in vivo (in living test subjects) due to these models, which would otherwise not be possible ethically. This is especially important for the study of immune systems but also is really valuable in the study of infectious disease and oncology.
